# OData Tutorial Guidelines

**What is this ?**

These are basic and advanced scenarios of features supported by OData V4.

**Why we need this ?**

For developers of OData libraries (both server and client) : you can use this guideline to help you build samples / tutorials / blog posts and show users how your product can effectively help them build and consume the RESTful services. 
For developers using OData (both producing and consuming) : you can play with the tools you'd like to choose with this guideline to learn them better.

**How to leverage this?**

The initial of this tutorial is inspired by [Basic tutorial](http://www.odata.org/getting-started/basic-tutorial/) and [Understanding OData in 6 steps](http://www.odata.org) and the service behind is the [TripPin Service](http://services.odata.org/V4/TripPinServiceRW). We have leveraged this on [Understand OData using POSTMAN collection](#)We have add the very common scenarios and structured as below. You can pick the approriated scenarios for your case. But most importantly, please ***contribute*** back :

 - Create a pull request of your scenarios not covered in the guidelines in a approriate section below or just  so that they can be regularly updated on [OData.Org](http://www.odata.org) and leveraged by other developers.
 - Open GitHub issues on this repo to report errors of an OData V4 request.
